# Leetcode

## About
Repository of Leetcode solutions I have done, primarily in C / C++.

For the C solutions, each problem contains the problem description and solution. The ```main()``` functions are the driver functions. When each program is run, a random test case will be generated and run through the solution with the output returned in the console. It is possible to comment out the code that randomly generates the test cases and hard code in your own test cases.

C++ programs are taken directly from my submitted Leetcode solution.

## Usage
Clone or download the repository and run ```make``` to compile the C programs. Each of those programs can then be run with the command ```./<program_name>```. Run ```make clean``` to remove the executables.
