# Leetcode

## About
Repository of Leetcode solutions I have done, primarily in C.

Each problem contains the problem description and solution. The ```main()``` functions are the driver functions. When each program is run, a random test case will be generated and run through the solution with the output returned in the console.
It is possible to comment out the code that randomly generates the test cases and hard code in your own test cases.

## Usage
Clone or download the repository and run ```make``` to compile the programs. Each program can then be run with the command ```./<program_name>```. Run ```make clean``` to remove the executables.
